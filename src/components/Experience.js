• Implemented small to medium sized site tech refreshes where I replaced the legacy WAN routers with newer 4300 series ISRs and Core switches with newer 3850 series Core switches and Access switches.
• Implemented access switches which were Layer 2 with a data and voice vlan for each IDF to create a more stable spanning tree environment.
• The core switches ran HSRP for redundancy and provided default gateways for all vlans and subnets.
• Configured BGP with route-maps and prefix lists to allow the 10.0.0.0/8 network and default route inbound and only send the summary route outbound.
• Implemented Nexus 7K VDCs, VPCs to Nexus 5Ks and FEX 2248s in the top of rack for server connectivity.
• Redistributed BGP into OSPF along with default-information originate to propagate the BGP routes into OSPF as E2 routes.
• Very comfortable with all the standard troubleshooting steps for OSPF, EIGRP and BGP such as sh ip bgp sum, sh ip bgp neigh x advertised-routes, sh ip ospf neigh, doing extended pings to stress test links etc.
• Created basic firewall policies on ASA 5525-X firewalls with both CLI and ASDM based on customer requirements.
• Updated rule sets on Palo Alto 3Ks based on gathering application requirements from the end customers and added necessary objects and policies.
• Added basics VIPs, pools, auto map, http health checks, custom health checks on F5 virtual edition load balancers.
• Created basic vSwitching within vCenter and assigned proper vlans to various VMs as needed by customers.
